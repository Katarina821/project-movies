# Project Movies

The projectbrief was to build a multi-page React application, using an API to fetch and display information about movies.

## The problem

This project was done in pairprogramming. We started by planning our two components and doing our first API-fetch, after that we built one compinent at the time. If we would have more time we would have worked more on the styling doing styled components and also worked more with the responsivness.
